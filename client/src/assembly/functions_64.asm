; thanks to pseudostripy for showing me how this is done
; and for creating a proof of concept version, making this possible

; this function allows us to get the itemlot id of an item that is being picked up
; since the itemGive function only receives the contents of the itemLot

; this is basically just recreating what happens in the function at 'DarkSoulsII.exe+1E5DD0'
; which is the function responsible for calling the function that sets the map item as picked up
; we do this because this function is called AFTER the item is already added to the inventory
; so we "replicate" what it does so we can obtain the itemlot id before the item is added to inventory
